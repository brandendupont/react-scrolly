# Section
## Basic scroll tracking of a component

Using `<Section>` and `<PageContext>`, you can track the following information of a component (`<Section>`) when it is scrolling with ease:

- **Visibility**: Whether the component is intersecting with the viewport.
- **Scroll progress**: The ratio of component being scrolled.
- **Position**: The position of the component relative to the viewport.

## Example

## Usage

### First, make sure to wrap `<PageContext>` at the page level

Before we get started, it is important to note that you have to wrap the components to track
with `<PageContext>`.

`<PageContext>` contains Observers which are essential to `<Section>`,
by allowing it to subscribe to the events such as window scrolling and resizing.
